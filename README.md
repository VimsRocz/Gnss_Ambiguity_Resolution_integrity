This repository contains MATLAB scripts and code for various data analysis tasks.

## Description
This repository contains MATLAB scripts and code snippets for analyzing and resolving ambiguities in positioning systems, with a focus on integrity analysis. The scripts provide implementations of algorithms and techniques for resolving ambiguities in positioning data, computing integrity metrics, and visualizing the results.

## Code Description

### Ambiguity_Resolution_and_Integrity_Analysis.m
This MATLAB script implements algorithms for ambiguity resolution and integrity analysis in positioning systems. It includes functionalities for:

- Ambiguity resolution using various techniques such as FARA and LAMBDA methods.
- Analysis of integrity metrics including VPL and VPE.
- Visualization of results through plots and diagrams.

The script is structured into sections corresponding to different tasks involved in ambiguity resolution and integrity analysis. Each section contains code snippets, variable definitions, and explanations to guide users through the implementation and analysis process.
